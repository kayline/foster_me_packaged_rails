# FosterMe Frontend

This is the React frontend for the FosterMe app.

I foster rescue kittens for the SPCA. There is a lot to manage. I'm building the app I wish I had.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running the app
```npm start```

## Running the tests
```npm test```
